Richard Gruet's Python Quick Reference.

Jan. 2014

Richard Gruet's Python Quick Reference (PQR) is hosted at http://rgruet.free.fr/ for many years.
As we are now multiple maintainers, I have created this git to support the multiple versions that might arrise.

The PQR can also be found at http://iysik.com/PQR2.7/PQR2.7.html
