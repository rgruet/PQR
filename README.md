Richard Gruet's Python Quick Reference
=======================================

Jan. 2014

Richard Gruet's Python Quick Reference (PQR) is hosted at http://rgruet.free.fr/ for many years.
As we are now multiple maintainers, I have created this git to support the multiple versions that might arrise.

The PQR can also be found at http://iysik.com/PQR2.7/PQR2.7.html

About this quick reference
--------------------------

There are other quick references, also on GitHub, se e.g. http://github.com/downloads/kroger/python-quick-ref/.
However this PQR is not a cheat sheet style reference; instead it is more of a complete Python reference on just 41 pages on most of the frequent features.

Started in 1995 by Chris Hoffmann for Python 1.3, it has since been maintained by Richard Gruet (who has hosted it for more than 10 years), with the help of Simon Brunning, Josh Stone and Stefan McKinnon Høj-Edwards.
